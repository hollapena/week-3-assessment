The internet in general, is a giant network of computers, which are connected by routers and servers. The world wide web, is the information and webpages that are sent back and forth, and stored on servers to be accessed by the network. On the internet, each computer is identified by its own name which is called an IP address, which is made up of four sets of numbers that are separated by dots. Since those are really difficult for humans to remember, we have nicknames for them that are called hostnames! Hostnames are words, which makes it much easier for us, as humans, to remember. When we enter a hostname a DNS(domain name service) has to translate it into an IP address. To do this it first checks our local cache, since it's the smallest pool of possible matches. If it can't find a match here, it moves to our router or local network to see if anyone on our network has a match. If this also fails, it then moves to our ISP's cache, which is a much larger pool and probably many times has a match. But if it still hasn't found a match within those pools, it then moves to the root DNS servers which checks the largest pool of all for a match! Once it converts the hostname to the correct IP address it can then send that IP address back to the browser so that it can make a request to the IP address to show the website!

When you click on a link, or type in a web address, the browser uses DNS to convert the hostname, and then the browser points to a webpage by making a get request which sends the url to the server which contains the hostname, protocol, any cookies that you've recieved from that host previously, and the resources that you're looking for. When the server recieves this request it then responds with the HTML text for that page as well as some other things like a response code that tells you what happened, the date, content type(text/json/etc), and information about cookies. This information then allows your browser to display the webpage!
